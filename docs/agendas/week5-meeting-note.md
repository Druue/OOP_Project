Date: 09/03/2020\
Note taker: Justin Jo

## CTA
- Required
    - calender overview of reservation
- Good to have
    - Add custom events (Not visible for the admin, only for the user for their own schedule)
    - Sharing an event (would be a nice feature to add)
    - Sorting reservations (alphabetically, building, etc)

## TA meeting
- COMMUNICATION!
    - Before you work on something, tell others and add an issue
    - Ask what you can do in this week's sprint if you were not in one of the meetings
    - When you are done with what you are doing, tell the group to see if you can help with anything
    - Make sure you are not doing anything someone else is doing -> Talk to each other!
    - If you are not sure about something and you want to work on something else, tell others because they can take it over
- Tests
    - Unit tests - test classes individually (Don't call other classes)
- Deadline for next week
    - CRUD for reservation and reservation entries (GUI)
    - Searching rooms (filter)
    - Advanced: bike and food reservation
