# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*


# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

Who will present the final product? Everyone, or 3-4 people?
---
> Everyone

Do all buildings have the same open days (including holidays)?
---
> Each building as its own opening hours, however there are public holidays which do apply to all buildings on campus.

What does the email address of an employee look like?
---
> Teachers have `name@tudelft.nl` as their email signature

Where can we host a postgres database?
---
> Heroku supports postgres, if we want to use MySql, we can use `projects.ewi.tudelft.nl` though we should try to avoid using that as a lot of people are and it's experiencing a server overload.

Should email verification be required?
---
> We can validate the email address and then effectively delegate validation to tudelft's single sign on.

What do guest accounts look like?
---
> Guests don't have accounts. You don't have to sign in / up to be able to view buildings & rooms, but you do need to have an account to make a reservation - not food.
