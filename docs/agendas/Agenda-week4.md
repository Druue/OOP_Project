# Database problems

- Short summary: There were varying degrees of problems regarding the database.
- Unsure of how to implement it, unsure of what to use.
- Lot of "wasted" time.
- Might be due to lack of explanation during the project introduction.
# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*


# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

- Q: Can we ask for more detailed help regarding technical issues?
- A: We can only ask him questions that don't directly pertain to Spring as he does not have knowledge around it.
- Q: Are security features a good addition?
- A: They are a good feature but we should only implement this if we have time.


# Closing

Week 4 meeting notes:

- Technical questions regarding the project can be asked but Dixit says that as he does not use Spring he cannot answer questions about Spring. 
- Use Vertex and Spark are alternatives to Spring that can be used and are less difficult. 
- The login page apparently is working and you can enter registration details about a client. 
- We need to implement the database with Spring itself and fix the compilation errors and check style errors. 
- Dimitar is still having some gradle import issues and his grade needs to be re-imported. 
- Reports are supposed to be available on Brightspace and this will be available at the end of the course. 
- Brightspace does not include information about the report but they will update this later. 
- SQL injection is not needed and only focus on security if there is actually time left. 
- The next sprint has to be planned in an organised way so we know exactly what we need to do.
- Thomas worked on setting the connection of front to back end
- Jo worked on login and adding buildings or rooms.
- Nikolo worked in login registration and the service methods that need to be created.
- There were issues with bean factory creation. As Spring doesn’t know how to map properly as it doesn’t know what the entities actually are.
- There is a exception to do with the element and entity relationship annotations
- The next sprint was being allocated and looked at carefully.
- Connection string has been done 
- The mockup reservations page is almost finished 
- Back-end controllers and serialisation of all of our entities need to be determined if they are necessary.
- The time frames and weights of each task and how difficult we think it could be. 
- We are going to keep all of our roles the same but if anyone wants to make changes then that person should try to make an effort for to ask the person in charge about that task.
