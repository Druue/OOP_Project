### Tips from TA-Meeting

##### - Create a backlog where everyone has roughly 14 hours worth of tasks for the week:
* Each person keeps track of time worked so that no overwork occurs
* At the meeting on Monday we have a structured overview of the past week, and if any problems had occured, it's easier to examine root causes

##### - _Set deadlines for tasks_

##### - The main focus (and biggest part of the grade) is the process, the product _is only a small part of the grade_. 
So as much as possible, don't stress over unmet deadlines and failed code. We are mostly learning how to work as a team and how to use Agile development methods

## Feedback 
#### _Of course it shouldn't be in a mean or disrespectful manner_
##### - It's helpful to receive (and give) feedback on what you can improve on and how
##### - Learn to speak up:
* When facing difficulty
* When someone's lagging behind with work you depend on - this is tied to setting deadlines. Discuss a deadline with that person (e.g. Can you have it done by Thursday,
so I can work on my things on Friday, because I'm busy on the weekend...

If they say yes, ok. Hold them accountable if they don't keep the deadline. 

If they say no,
then this is a scheduling issue. Drop the issues that depend on that and discuss with the team a restructuring in order to meet a deadline, or what tasks to take instead
in order for you to be able to do your fair part
