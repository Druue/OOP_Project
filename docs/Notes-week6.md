Entities conflicts. Dimitar's commit, a ton of entities and schema changes not discussed.
This morning Sophie and Thomas spent hours fixing it

Dixit: Decide on a schema. If something everybody agrees on something, implement it. If there is
something that someone thinks would improve it, discuss it with the group. If everybody
agrees, implement it. Discuss it well first

Everybody should know how the application works in general. Not every line of code, but each general
part.  

Sophie: Setup a Docker guide. Sorting out the schema and database stuff with Mylene

Mylene: Getting the database to run (with the old schema) on Thursday on Nikko's and Thomas' laptops. Fixing entities
and schema logic

Ayham: Fixed some things on a single branch, but the entities he fixed were connected and would create conflicts. There are a 
TON of conflicts.
Working on filtering. Everything is on local machine

Discuss how to change the entities so that filtering wouldn't break anything.

TODO: @Ayham Make a guide with all the changes you want to make in order to implement filtering and put it on GitLab


We should take some time to merge and make sure everything works well together so far.
Sophie fixed all checkstyle errors in merge/week5

When Sophie pulls most code, she gets a ton of Checkstyle errors, "Did you mean that instead" errors and so on...


When committing, make sure to _AutoFormat_. TODO: Spend a few minutes setting up IntelliJ for autoformatting...
Make sure to name your variables well, because that could create a lot of conflicts if renamed in the future.


TODO: Turn on AutoFormat on Save. And change what AutoFormat does - does it change only your code, all, does it rearrange, etc...

_Get everything you have right now work well together, then work from there._

Deadlines:

Reservations work and can be deleted.


Q:"Communication might continue this way..."
A:"Dixit will talk to Yoshi and will reply by tomorrow. D will reply ASAP"
